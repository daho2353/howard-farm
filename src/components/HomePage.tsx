        <p>
          Since 2022, we've been dedicated to growing fresh, quality produce and sharing the
          flavors of our heritage with our community. At Howard Farm, we not only cultivate our own
          fruits, vegetables, and herbs, but we also use them to create delicious, homemade recipes
          inspired by a lineage of skilled chefs and cooks in our family. Each product we offer is
          crafted with care, combining generations of culinary expertise with the freshest
          ingredients straight from our fields.
